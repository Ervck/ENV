          <h2 id="box1">What Is Your Carbon Footprint?</h2>

          <p>
            A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, service, place or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Greenhouse gases, including the carbon-containing gases carbon dioxide and methane, can be emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, land clearance and the production and consumption of food, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other services.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Food accounts for 10-30% of a household’s carbon footprint, typically a higher portion in lower-income households</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>For each kWh generated in the U.S., an average of 0.889 pounds of CO2e is released at the power plant.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>The average passenger car emits 0.78 pounds of CO2 per mile driven.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="box2">What Are The Effects Of Our Carbon Footprint?</h2>

          <p>Carbon emissions are extremely threatening to the health of our planet and everything that lives on it. Due to our carbon emissions trapped in our atmosphere global warming has become a very serious issue that continues to worsen. As we all know, the polar ice caps continue to melt at an alarming rate, the sea level continues to rise, and extreme weather occurs more often. If we don’t make an effort to combat climate change, the melting of the ice sheets and rising sea levels could very much lead to the flooding of most major global coastal cities. wildlife habitats will be destroyed, extreme weather like droughts and heatwaves would become increasingly more common, and food production would ultimately be affected as well.</p>



          <h2 id="box3">What Can We Do To Reduce Our Carbon Emissions?</h2>

          <p>
            When deciding to change your lifestyle for the sake of the environment things may seem daunting at first glance and you may feel as if you can't do much to reduce your carbon footprint, although small changes can make an overall big difference in the long run, you mayfeel comfortable trying some of these carbon reducing actions:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Limit meat consumption</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
